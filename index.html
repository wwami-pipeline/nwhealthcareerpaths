                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since the 1970’s health professionals have known of a lack of primary care physicians in the Pacific Northwest region, as
                            there is in many parts of the country. Low percentages of urban areas compared to other parts
                            of the country, economic woes, and systemic lack of opportunity for doctors in underserved areas
                            all led to this issue. Making the issue worse was the simple fact that, in the four most rural
                            states in the greater PNW (Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho), the closest and only accredited
                            medical school was situated hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away at the University of Washington
                            School of Medicine. Realizing that the current distribution of health sciences education would
                            only continue the trend of rural and underserved areas lacking doctors, the WWAMI Regional Medical
                            Education Program was created by UW Medicine in 1971.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are five stated goals of WWAMI:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="browser-default">
                            <li>provide publicly supported medical education </li>
                            <li>increase the number of primary-care physicians</li>
                            <li>provide community-based medical education </li>
                            <li>expand graduate medical education (residency training) and continuing medical education</li>
                            <li>provide all of this in a cost-effective manner</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="center-align">
                            <img class="responsive-img" src="assets/States.png" />
                            <p class="italic-light">The five states of the WWAMI Region.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Over the next 47 years the WWAMI Program would develop into a heralded and innovative approach to tackling community-focused
                            medical health training. However, while WWAMI can claim influence over thousands of individual
                            organizations promoting the goals stated above, its nature as more of a coordinator rather than
                            a direct supervisor often leaves it not knowing exactly where programs are effective and where
                            they aren’t. With other, more regional organizations such as the Western Washington Area Health
                            Education Center (AHEC) network more directly responsible for the day to day operations of these
                            programs, information is seldom shared between programs, regions, and states, and students are
                            often left unaware of which programs cater to their needs. With a lack of solid knowledge of
                            the strengths and weaknesses of each affiliate program, the three problems identified by our
                            team were the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="browser-default">
                            <li>A lack of basic record collection leading to incomplete pictures of where programs are, how many
                                exist, and what services they provide</li>
                            <li>No method for organizing and distributing this information to the students who require it</li>
                            <li>No mechanism for the strategic analysis and distribution of information between programs, leading
                                to an inability to target resources to areas that need attention</li>

                        </ul>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="solution" class="scrollspy">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col m9 offset-m1 s12">
                        <h2>The Solution</h2>

                        <h3>A New Survey </h3>
                        <p>
                            The first step was establishing a reliable method of collecting information. WWAMI had already created a survey but it was
                            long, difficult to complete, and lacked measures to ensure essential pieces of information were
                            given accurately and completely. Due to these issues, our initial analysis of the data given
                            to us found that of the roughly 1,000 responses recorded, only 5% of the questions had recorded
                            answers, and most of the data was rendered useless due to lack of identifying information (no
                            recorded contact information, no address, etc.). We used these insights to design a new survey,
                            one which would require a number of basic inputs to be filled out before submission. We also
                            removed or revised many questions which were unnecessary or confusing. After rigorous testing
                            and several iterations the new survey was released at a summit of WWAMI leaders and affiliates.
                            The improvements lead to a near perfect response rate, with up to 80% of non-required fields
                            filled out. In addition, addresses, contact information, and other essential pieces of information
                            are now recorded flawlessly. With this new survey instrument WWAMI has been provided a foundation
                            upon which further analysis and solutions can now be built.

                        </p>
                        <h3>The Mapping Tool</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the team could be assured we had a quality data set to start with, it was time to solve the remaining problems. For
                            a while, WWAMI had envisioned a suite of web applications that would connect students with opportunities
                            in their region, allow them to blog about their experiences, and serve as a hub of information
                            for program administrators and affiliate organizations to share ideas, list resources, and promote
                            collaboration. To meet as many needs as possible in the 6 month time frame we had, we chose to
                            prioritize the needs of the students in their search for programs. To this end, we created a
                            mapping tool that would bring to life the information recently collected from our new survey.
                            With this tool, students have the ability to locate services close to them, refine their searches
                            with a set of options most important to them, and see those results visualized on a map. With
                            such a tool students can take matter into their own hands and no longer have to rely on information
                            that a partnering organization might not have.
                        </p>

                        <div class="center-align">
                            <img class="responsive-img" src="assets/Map-Initial-View.svg" />
                            <p class="italic-light">
                                With the mapping tool, students can easily find relevant programs in their area
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Students are not the only ones who can gain insight from this mapping tool. The administrators of the WWAMI Regional Medical
                            Education Program fulfill their goal of filling gaps in program coverage. By using the tool they
                            are able to pinpoint regions where specific needs are not being met, and areas where there are
                            robust pathways established for students to navigate throughout their time in school. Their goal
                            is to use this information to inform where to send more resources and which organizations can
                            be be identified as extremely successful.
