                                Thousands of students in need. Five states with shortages of primary care physicians. One medical school trying to turn the
                                tide. As part of UW Medicine,

                                outreach, and students can find the services they need to succeed as healthcare professionals.

                            Since the 1970â€™s health professionals have known of a lack of primary care physicians 
                            in the Greater Pacific Northwest region.
                            As the only accredited medical school in the area, the task fell on the UW School of Medicine
                            to solve this problem.

                            The data that fuels Waypoint was created practically from scratch. We designed a method of data collection for the WWAMI
                            Inititiave that enables them to collect clean, extensive information for an ever growing number
                            of outreach programs. As more organizations provide this information, Waypoint will provide a
                            greater wealth of information.

                            Waypoint was built on the premise that good tools rely on good data. Knowing that organizational needs change, we made the
                            database that houses all of the information we've gathered available as its own tool. Through
                            our partner Seattle Data for Good, all of the details of this project and instructions for using
                            the data derived from it will be made available to an entire community of innovators who will
                            continue to help the WWAMI Initiative acheive its goal of eliminating the shortage of physicians
